**Macramé Network was founded in 2004** in northeast Italy, a region known for its entrepreneurial spirit, **as a network of professionals** that would provide communication and design services.

**Today most things people seek are just a click away.** This means that things are fast and simple and people expect quality products at a reasonable price.

**Macramé was a step ahead of this trend:** its services are on-demand and global. Our collaborators are based all over the world but work together to create fast, affordable communication and design solutions.

**As a design agency that curates project teams for every new brief**, we have constructed a vast network of talents from around the world: designers, art directors, illustrators, copywriters, typeface artists and photographers who really understand projects needs, and bringing their expert skills to the table, every time.

**We've invested a lot of time and energy in putting together a close-knit network that knows no time zones.** We’ve done it with care, considering each member’s special set of skills, professionalism and honesty. We give them the same attention we give our clients because they are equally important.  

**Nothing pleases us more than putting together the right team to bring a project to life.** 

**We can respond to the specific demands of our clients and find the best solution at a fair price.**

**Because we are small enough to listen and big enough to deliver.**
