**Macramè Network was founded in 2004** in northeast Italy, a region known for its entrepreneurial spirit, **as a network of professionals that provides communication and design services for creative agencies.**

**Today most things clients seek are just a click away.** This means that things have to be fast and simple and they expect quality products at a reasonable price.

Macramè was a step ahead of this trend: our services are on-demand and global.

**We’ve invested a lot of time and energy in putting together a close-knit network of talent.** We’ve done it with care, considering each member’s special set of skills, professionalism and honesty. 

> “Nothing pleases us more than putting together **the right team to bring a project to life**.”
> * On Our Process

**Our collaborators are based all over the world but work together to create fast, affordable communication and design solutions.**

**Producers that can support the full production process** and find the best solution to save you time, money and resources.

As a company that curates project teams for every new brief, **nothing pleases us more than putting together the right team to bring a project to life.**
