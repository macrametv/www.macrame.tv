  **Ariel Di Lisio**, or how good timing is essential to success in business and
  in life.

    Time is of the essence, people say. Only time will tell, we all believe. But
    in this case, it’s absolutely true. Time has always played a big part in
    Ariel’s career. 


    **He always knew the right time to switch jobs.**

    When the time was right to move to Mexico to teach at CEDIM University in Monterrey. And even when to partner with a former of his students there to create a new studio and work on that very same university’s branding and design system.

    **Yes, time. Time is a constant in Ariel’s story.** Like the time he was having lunch with his parents and a friend asked if he would go to Europe with him.


    **A week later he was landing in Madrid.**

    Was it an impulsive decision? Some might think so, but the truth is, the time was just right. And he knew it. That trip shaped him in many ways. As a person and as a designer. It shaped him as a typographer. 


    **He also knew when it was the right time to create his own studio.** And that was very early in his career. From the very beginning, Ariel knew he did not want to depend on someone else’s luck or business skills. Having his studio was his way to be in absolute control, to rely only on his own talent and efforts, to feel safe. So, he started his own creative business.

    But having his structure was not only offering him a safe environment. It also gave him the chance to try new things, to shape his product and to create a personal style.


    “The kind of design I do is very modern, but at the same time, quite clean and simple. That does not mean I don’t take chances. I always take some risks to help the project grow and go further. But the most important thing is to realize how far or how big a risk you can take, without falling.”


    One of those risks was to put his passion for typography to good use.
