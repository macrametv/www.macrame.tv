    Time is of the essence, people say. Only time will tell, we all believe. But
    in this case, it’s absolutely true. Time has always played a big part in
    Ariel’s career. 


    **He always knew the right time to switch jobs.**

    When the time was right to move to Mexico to teach at CEDIM University in Monterrey. And even when to partner with a former of his students there to create a new studio and work on that very same university’s branding and design system.

    **At some point, something happened. One of her high school teachers taught a class on fonts**. Fer had no idea you could make fonts for a living. In fact, she hadn’t even considered graphic design until then. But the shapes were still on her mind so she decided to give it a try.


    **And surprise, surprise... she loved it.** Everything about it. She loved the classes on graphic design, the ways of thinking about design and actually designing. She loved every single letter, every single family of fonts, and that made her see them from a completely different perspective.
