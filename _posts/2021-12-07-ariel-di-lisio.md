    Once upon a time, there was a little girl who dreamed of being a figure
    skater. It wasn't so much about the skating as the shapes and figures that
    drew her in.


    **Precise lines and beautiful shapes** are two things figure skating and design share. After going to see Castles on Ice,  she decided that figure skating wasn't for her. She still wanted to create shapes, but in a slightly different way.


    **In high school, she started thinking she would go to college for design**. At first, she was interested in industrial design​, because ​“you create actual things."

    **At some point, something happened. One of her high school teachers taught a class on fonts**. Fer had no idea you could make fonts for a living. In fact, she hadn’t even considered graphic design until then. But the shapes were still on her mind so she decided to give it a try.


    **And surprise, surprise... she loved it.** Everything about it. She loved the classes on graphic design, the ways of thinking about design and actually designing. She loved every single letter, every single family of fonts, and that made her see them from a completely different perspective.
