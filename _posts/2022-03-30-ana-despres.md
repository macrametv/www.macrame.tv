    Ana loves to travel. Yes, we all do. But in her case it is more like a
    necessity. She doesn't travel to be inspired or to meet new people, well,
    she does, but that’s a side effect of her nomadic way of living and working.
    She travels for business purposes. 


    **She has clients all around the world.** Most likely because she is the kind of creative that is always changing, evolving, mutating; depending on the needs of the project. And her clients love that about her. That need to move, to change, to be inspired by something different all the time.

    **"The best part of my travels is that I don’t want to stay in a place.** I mean it. Most people get to a place and picture themselves living or working there. I don’t. I might love a place, but I won’t be staying for long. I need to move, all the time."
