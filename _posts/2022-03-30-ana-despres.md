    Ana loves to travel. Yes, we all do. But in her case it is more like a
    necessity. She doesn't travel to be inspired or to meet new people, well,
    she does, but that’s a side effect of her nomadic way of living and working.
    She travels for business purposes. 


    **She has clients all around the world.** Most likely because she is the kind of creative that is always changing, evolving, mutating; depending on the needs of the project. And her clients love that about her. That need to move, to change, to be inspired by something different all the time.

    **She started taking classes on type design and calligraphy**, shaping her career based on her love for letters. And ​now she sells her own fonts.


    **Inspired by people, music and movies,** this typeface artist, calligrapher and designer from Argentina has given several workshops on experimental type design, calligraphy and monograms.


    **She has been a regular at the Tipos Latinos Argentina biennial** since 2010, and her Síncopa Font has been selected for other renowned type design exhibitions such as Pangramme.


    **Is her talent fueled by *mate*, wine, food and the jaded Argentine mindset?**\

    Maybe. Maybe not.


    But one thing's for sure: **Fer's completely different approach to design** can be attributed to her love for letters and expertise.

    **Her knowledge about fonts gives her a completely different perspective**
    than other graphic designers. ​You can choose a family based on your idea,
    but each family has a bunch of different fonts and each one is unique: “It’s
    not the style that makes the difference: it's the actual font!”


    **We can try to explain the growing importance of type design** but Fer puts it best: “There used to be a certain romanticism associated with choosing a font. Now it's a question of budget: creating your own font is ultimately the best way to go."


    Companies like Apple, Google, Netflix and Spotify, all of which have designed their own fonts, would clearly agree with her.

    **But she’s not only devoted to letters: she also loves to teach.**\

    Fer teachers graduate classes at the University of Buenos Aires and loves sharing her knowledge with her colleagues.


    **And that has shaped her professional network.**\

    “I mostly work with students past and present. They're my trusted network."


    She loves teaching, yes, **and what she most enjoys about working with Macramè** ​is that there are a lot of people involved in each project and she has the opportunity to share her knowledge and learn.


    When it came to designing an identity for Pizzeria Al-4m she and the team had to work from scratch on the concepts, ideas, deliverables, etc. They had total freedom to come up with innovative ideas, from the restaurant menu to the card holder and other items.


    “The most challenging part was managing ideas and drafts from Argentina while producing in Europe. But it was also fun and very rewarding!”

    **That's the story of the girl who fell in love with letters**. So in love,
    in fact, that her hedgehog Aidé, who was along for five years of her
    journey, even has her own font.


    **That love shines through: Fer received** the ​Sello Buen Diseño​ in 2018 and a year later, was selected as one of ten ​Ascenders by the Type Directors Club​, a group of designers under 35 who have shown remarkable achievement in typography, type design, and lettering.
