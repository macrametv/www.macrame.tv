    Ana loves to travel. Yes, we all do. But in her case it is more like a
    necessity. She doesn't travel to be inspired or to meet new people, well,
    she does, but that’s a side effect of her nomadic way of living and working.
    She travels for business purposes. 


    **She has clients all around the world.** Most likely because she is the kind of creative that is always changing, evolving, mutating; depending on the needs of the project. And her clients love that about her. That need to move, to change, to be inspired by something different all the time.

    **The best part of my travels is that I don’t want to stay in a place.** I mean it. Most people get to a place and picture themselves living or working there. I don’t. I might love a place, but I won’t be staying for long. I need to move, all the time.

    > * On Working on Different Time-Zones


    **That's probably why, she was once in 3 different cities in a single day. **Yes, 3 cities, one day. But that’s not just it. It was way more than that. It was 3 different cities. 3 different countries. 3 different languages. And 3 different clients. She was running a photoshoot in Paris in the morning when she had to take a plane to Barcelona to meet a different client. Only to fly to London a few hours later to meet her business partner there to start working on a completely different project, for yet another client. 

    Sounds crazy? Yes. Sounds like Ana? Definitely. 


    **“That was the first time I felt like a chameleon.** I had to change my whole perspective extremely fast and mutate on the go to be ready for the next assignment. It was crazy and intense. I loved it!” 


    **And that’s why she keeps 10 different timezones on her phone.** She has all the different clocks for where her clients and partners are based, to be connected whenever they need it. And she also has Tokyo time in there. Does she have anything going on in Tokyo, not really, but it’s 12 hours apart from her home and it makes her believe she can have a glimpse into the future. When she’s living today in Argentina, they are literally living tomorrow in Japan.

    **But there’s another pillar to Ana’s approach when developing a project.** She's always looking at the bigger picture. No matter what the briefing was about in the first place, she always thinks it could go bigger, better, more committed, and with a higher purpose. And she goes for it, every single time.   


    **And that’s also why she connects immediately with clients and partners from different countries and cultures.** From Korto Café, a small coffee shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina (where she was born) to Sorgente Group, a top Real Estate company in the U.S. From Hellow Festival, a music festival in Monterrey, Mexico, to Nicolas Laisne Architects a world-famous architecture studio from France.   


    **They all dream of doing great things.** Not only in their business, but also to change the world. And Annie is the perfect partner to help them do so.

    > * On Purpose


    **Even an oil company can help make the world a better place if they want to.**I’m here to help them do so.


    **Cause all her clients have something to say.** Something to show. Something to help make the world a better place. That’s what she loves about them. That’s why she has such a strong connection to all of them. Not in a mysterious random way, but similar energies tend to bond and Ana finds herself perfectly fit to develop this kind of projects, projects that aim to help us all.


    **This purpose-driven approach was born when she met a Mexican influencer who was helping women improve their self-esteem regardless of their appearance.** That was an eye-opener for her. That was some kind of calling. She knew she could help. She knew there was space for improvement in every single business, in every single project. So she set her mind to it.


    **“Even an oil company can help make the world a better place if they want to.** And I’m here to help them do so”.

    **So, yes, Ana Despres is a dreamer.** An idealist. And a tireless traveler. She travels the world, she travels through time and even to the stars! 


    **She’s a huge fan of space stuff and an amateur astronomer.** She has a nice telescope to see the moon, some stars, and maybe Jupiter when the conditions are at their best. And that telescope not only gives her a whole new world to travel around, but also an incredible sense of freedom and opportunity.


    **“The best part about owning a telescope is that it allows you to be an amateur again.** You don’t have that pressure of getting it right. Of achieving. You can get it wrong as many times as you want and I find that incredibly liberating. You need to find spaces to be an amateur again.”

    > * On Macramè


    **That’s also why she immediately felt we were a great fit for her when in 2018 she worked with us for the first time.**


    **“I found the working dynamic very interesting!** The freedom, the projects… At that time I was working half-time in another place so this dynamic with Macramè gave me the tools and empowerment I needed to go full-time freelance, and that’s something I’ll always be thankful for”. 


    **Freedom and opportunity.** The two things that Macramè stands for. The two things that allow Ana to try to change the world, one project at a time.
