    His name is Sebastián Carrasco. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in
    the mid-80s and he is a 3rd-dan black-belt martial artist. So be careful
    when you have a look at his portfolio. 


    Fortunately for him and all of us, this illustrator and graphic designer won’t let you down. He’s the full package. Not only does he have a huge talent for turning people and spaces into complex but at the same time extremely simple illustrations; he also has a great eye for art direction and the perfect balance that allows him to find the perfect strategy and concept for each project.

    **And it all started early in his career with his first job.** A job he thought would be more about design but turned out to be almost fully about illustration. A job where he went from art rookie to the artist in charge of illustrations that world-famous models were wearing on the catwalk at an international fashion show.


    **Yes, he has a habit of doing that... **Whatever he does, he takes it to the next level.

    > * On Zona de Obras


    **That’s why when he first stepped into Zona de Obras,** the design studio where he still works 14 years on, they couldn’t let him go. 


    **There, he works as a Senior Designer, Art Director, and consultant in branding and strategic brand management.** But that’s not all. Lately, as part of the process of promoting the studio's digital profile, he also coordinates the development of UX/UI projects, while leading the whole initiative on all different fronts. Quite impressive. 


    **So when he told us that one of the most famous singers in Argentina** has a portrait done by him on his wall, well, we were not surprised. 


    **“Not long ago I saw on social media that Bahiano,** ex-singer of Los Pericos, has a quite large painting in his living room with an illustration of his face that I did for the cover of a record. I don’t even think he remembers who I am or where that illustration came from, but it's there. As part of his home decoration.”


    **But how can he be so successful in everything he does?** 

    Fair question.
