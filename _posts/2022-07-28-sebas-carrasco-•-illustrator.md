    His name is Sebastián Carrasco. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in
    the mid-80s and he is a 3rd-dan black-belt martial artist. So be careful
    when you have a look at his portfolio. 


    Fortunately for him and all of us, this illustrator and graphic designer won’t let you down. He’s the full package. Not only does he have a huge talent for turning people and spaces into complex but at the same time extremely simple illustrations; he also has a great eye for art direction and the perfect balance that allows him to find the perfect strategy and concept for each project.

    **And it all started early in his career with his first job.** A job he thought would be more about design but turned out to be almost fully about illustration. A job where he went from art rookie to the artist in charge of illustrations that world-famous models were wearing on the catwalk at an international fashion show.


    **Yes, he has a habit of doing that... **Whatever he does, he takes it to the next level.
