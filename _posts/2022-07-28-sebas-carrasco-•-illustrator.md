    His name is Sebastián Carrasco. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in
    the mid-80s and he is a 3rd-dan black-belt martial artist. So be careful
    when you have a look at his portfolio. 


    Fortunately for him and all of us, this illustrator and graphic designer won’t let you down. He’s the full package. Not only does he have a huge talent for turning people and spaces into complex but at the same time extremely simple illustrations; he also has a great eye for art direction and the perfect balance that allows him to find the perfect strategy and concept for each project.

    Born in Buenos Aires in 1979, Leandro (or Caste, as his friends call him) always finds different ways to do things, different approaches and different people to work with. 


    **He claims it is mostly luck, but the truth is he surrounds himself with the most varied talent.** He knows a lot of people and a lot of people know him. That special connection started when he was teaching Tipografía 2 at Universidad de Buenos Aires. Those connections shaped his career.


    **“I’m always motivated by others.** By their energy, by the connection built. And when you find that special connection, projects find their own way.”


    **Like the time he moved to the U.S. to work on a project based in New York City.** He did not give it much thought. He just did it, not looking back, as he always does.


    **Fortunately, he immediately fell in love with the city.**
