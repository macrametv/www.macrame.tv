    There’s a specific energy surrounding Juano Fortin. A chilled, yet powerful
    energy. Maybe that’s because he was born in a household dominated by women.
    Or maybe it’s his way to fight the toxic masculinity of his hometown. Or
    maybe it’s his deep connection with nature, an important aspect of his life
    and development.


    **The thing is that Juano is a special kind of soul.** One of those people you just like from the very beginning. He feels like a friend. Or a distant yet close relative.


    **But his zen energy definitely defines him.** Defining also his ways of living and doing. That’s why he moved to Olivos, Buenos Aires, Argentina, in search of peace of mind, birds singing, and a quiet place to live and work. A place described in his own words as:

    “Kind of stuck in time.”

    **A place that turned out to be the perfect environment** for this curious soul to escape from the chaos of Buenos Aires city, where he used to live.  


    **“I love to move at a slow pace.** I love old people and their slow habits. I love silence.”


    **But the thing he loves the most is the river.** And he enjoys a lot having it close to his house because it is an important aspect of his day-to-day life. And there's no better therapy for him than sitting by the river facing the sun. And just breathe.


    **That’s his daily base of inspiration.**
