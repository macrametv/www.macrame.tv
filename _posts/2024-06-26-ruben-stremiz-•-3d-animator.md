    Born in 1976 in a suburban town west of Buenos Aires, Martin Laksman always
    wanted to be a goalkeeper. His dream: helping the club he loved,
    Independiente, to conquer the world once again.


    **He played soccer for many years and truly enjoyed it,** but at some point he decided to leave that behind. Why? Well, to embark on a career in illustration and graphic design.\

    When you see what his hands are capable of, you may ask what could have happened if he had stuck with football.

    **But there's a way more important question here:** was he a great goalkeeper because of his amazing drawing skills? Or is he a talented illustrator because he used his hands to knock flying balls far from the net?


    **We’ll never know for sure.** But one thing we do know is that since he was a little boy, he loved drawing. And playing soccer, of course. But in Martín's own words: “All the memories I have are of me drawing stuff."
