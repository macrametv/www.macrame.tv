    Talking to Ruben Stremiz is like talking to your aunt or your grandmother.

    But in a good way.

    He has this calm soothing presence that immediately makes you feel good.


    **Maybe that’s because he’s a yoga enthusiast** studying to help others practice at their best.

    Or maybe it’s just his flowing mindfulness that helps you find the perfect balance.

    Whatever it is one thing is for sure: He knows what he wants.

    **That’s why when he finished high school** and needed to decide what to study next, he did not think twice. 

    He already knew what he was going to do. 

    What he was meant to be. 

    So he studied “Image and Sound Design” at the University of Buenos Aires.


    **He had always loved animation**, animated stories, and characters, so his path was already clear.


    **“Since I was young, I’ve loved animation** and its capacity to create new fantastic worlds and incredible situations.”


    **This was a path that kept opening in different directions**, presenting choices, making him evolve, leading him from one place to the next. He traveled to different destinations while discovering cultures and new ways of doing and thinking.

    > I always choose places where **I can get lost**

    >

    > * On Travelling


    **“When I’m looking for a new place to visit,** I always choose places where I can get lost, where I don't understand the language. I love places that have a specific history and culture to explore and learn from. And if the city has a beach, that’s just an awesome bonus.”


    **Don’t get confused, Ruben is not a tourist.** He’s a traveler. 

    He’s not living on holiday. He works hard in every single place he visits.


    **That’s because he always has a new horizon in mind.** A place he would love to be living when developing a specific project.


    **And when the project kicks off,** well, he just needs to be there. 

    For as long as it takes.

    > **I grew up a lot during lockdown**, both as a person and as a
    professional

    > * On His Philosophy


    **But moving around is not his only kind of inspiration.** Some of his best work was developed during lockdown when he was forced to be in one place for a long period of time. Alone.


    **“I grew up a lot during lockdown,** both as a person and as a professional.”


    **In his mind, lockdown was not a hard time.** It was an opportunity.

    A chance to find himself, to feel, to think, and get to the story he wanted to tell next. A time when he could immerse himself in a truly personal project: Pluma in Quarantine.


    **The project allowed him to create small capsules of content,** offering the world his unique and refreshing perspective of right and wrong.


    **This project also made him realize he could do it all.** From the idea to the script. From the storyboard to the final cut.

    That was huge.

    That was a game-changer. That was a whole new world for him.

    > **It let him make the jump** to integrated intellectual property producer

    >

    > * On Simona & Jaques Project


    **That realization led to work for Disney**, Netflix, Fox, CocaCola, AXN, Antena3, and Amazon, among others.


    **That’s also why he’s now developing Simona & Jaques**, Learning to hunt monsters; an animated series for a pretty well-known TV network.


    **An idea that was awarded 1st Place** in the 5th pitch for Cartoon Network at Chilemonos International Animation Festival, in 2020.


    **An idea that let him make the jump** from animator and creator to integrated intellectual property producer.

    > **It leaves space for creative momentum**

    >

    > * On Macramè Network


    **This new Ruben fits better with Macramè’s philosophy.**

    A place where he can be himself and develop a project with his unique touch. A place where he can be appreciated for what he is, not only for what he does. 

    A place where he can simply do good.


    **“Macramè is a very professional creative network** that leaves space for creative momentum. Space to explore and play with the endless possibilities of design and animation. And that shows in the outcome.”


    **In his opinion, that’s the kind of creative shop that will survive.** 

    The kind of creative shop that actually has a chance to make a difference. 


    **Places where nobody settles for only doing what others are,** but driven to do something completely different. Something unique, risky, unconventional.

    Something truly creative.

    **“If you always do something that sounds, looks, or smells like something done before,** well… that’s just the kind of approach that could be easily replaced by an A.I.”


    **And those shops, those spaces, those open-minded environments are key.** Not only for business purposes but for humankind to keep going. To keep learning and growing. 

    To keep finding new ways of expressing what we all have in our minds. 

    Freely, positively, and creatively. 


    **As Ruben does. 

    As Ruben is.**
