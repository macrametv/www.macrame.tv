    Talking to Ruben Stremiz is like talking to your aunt or your grandmother.

    But in a good way.

    He has this calm soothing presence that immediately makes you feel good.


    **Maybe that’s because he’s a yoga enthusiast** studying to help others practice at their best.

    Or maybe it’s just his flowing mindfulness that helps you find the perfect balance.

    Whatever it is one thing is for sure: He knows what he wants.

    **That’s why when he finished high school** and needed to decide what to study next, he did not think twice. 

    He already knew what he was going to do. 

    What he was meant to be. 

    So he studied “Image and Sound Design” at the University of Buenos Aires.


    **He had always loved animation**, animated stories, and characters, so his path was already clear.


    **“Since I was young, I’ve loved animation** and its capacity to create new fantastic worlds and incredible situations.”


    **This was a path that kept opening in different directions**, presenting choices, making him evolve, leading him from one place to the next. He traveled to different destinations while discovering cultures and new ways of doing and thinking.

    > * On Travelling


    **“When I’m looking for a new place to visit,** I always choose places where I can get lost, where I don't understand the language. I love places that have a specific history and culture to explore and learn from. And if the city has a beach, that’s just an awesome bonus.”


    **Don’t get confused, Ruben is not a tourist.** He’s a traveler. 

    He’s not living on holiday. He works hard in every single place he visits.


    **That’s because he always has a new horizon in mind.** A place he would love to be living when developing a specific project.


    **And when the project kicks off,** well, he just needs to be there. 

    For as long as it takes.
