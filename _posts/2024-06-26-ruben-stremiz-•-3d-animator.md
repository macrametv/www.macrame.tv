    Talking to Ruben Stremiz is like talking to your aunt or your grandmother.

    But in a good way.

    He has this calm soothing presence that immediately makes you feel good.


    **Maybe that’s because he’s a yoga enthusiast studying to help others practice at their best.**

    Or maybe it’s just his flowing mindfulness that helps you find the perfect balance.

    Whatever it is one thing is for sure: He knows what he wants.

    **That’s why when he finished high school** and needed to decide what to study next, he did not think twice. 

    He already knew what he was going to do. 

    What he was meant to be. 

    So he studied “Image and Sound Design” at the University of Buenos Aires.


    **He had always loved animation**, animated stories, and characters, so his path was already clear.


    **“Since I was young, I’ve loved animation** and its capacity to create new fantastic worlds and incredible situations.”


    **This was a path that kept opening in different directions**, presenting choices, making him evolve, leading him from one place to the next. He traveled to different destinations while discovering cultures and new ways of doing and thinking.
