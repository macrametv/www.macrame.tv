    Talking to Ruben Stremiz is like talking to your aunt or your grandmother.

    But in a good way.

    He has this calm soothing presence that immediately makes you feel good.


    **Maybe that’s because he’s a yoga enthusiast studying to help others practice at their best.**

    Or maybe it’s just his flowing mindfulness that helps you find the perfect balance.

    Whatever it is one thing is for sure: He knows what he wants.

    **But there's a way more important question here:** was he a great goalkeeper because of his amazing drawing skills? Or is he a talented illustrator because he used his hands to knock flying balls far from the net?


    **We’ll never know for sure.** But one thing we do know is that since he was a little boy, he loved drawing. And playing soccer, of course. But in Martín's own words: “All the memories I have are of me drawing stuff."
