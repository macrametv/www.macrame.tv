  **Matteo de Mayda** or how a picture can actually change the world.
sections:
  section: >-
    Everybody can take great pictures. Everybody can capture the soul of a
    moment. Or at least that’s what the new iPhone makes us all believe. But the
    truth is that being a photographer is way more than just taking beautiful
    pictures. 


    **Being a photographer is having the power in your hands to make people believe.** To make them open their eyes and see what’s really going on out there. Being a photographer has nothing to do with having a camera in your pocket or hanging from your neck.


    **Being a photographer is being prepared to do whatever it takes.** To fly wherever you have to. To meet whomever you need to meet in order to find the right story. To tell the world there’s something more than what they see on social media.

    **And that’s where Matteo de Mayda feels more comfortable,** looking deep into what’s actually out there and telling that story to the world. Finding the path to people’s hearts. One picture at a time.


    **That’s why this Italian living in Treviso flew around the world several times.** From China to Kenya, from Algeria to Guatemala he just boarded every plane that could lead him to a great story.


    **Stories of change. Stories with purpose.** Stories of how a bicycle can make the world a better place or even how pastry can actually make a whole culture rethink things.


    **And that’s why, a few years ago, he quit his job** as an agency graphic designer to pursue his dream.

    **And that something was the content.** He felt there was a story behind every project he was working on, but the story was not properly covered, or told.


    **And when he was feeling all that, when he was in need of a change, Macramé contacted him to work on a photography project.** The project: The WorldWide Cycling Atlas. A project that took him to Guatemala and allowed him to test himself as a photographer, offering the world a new perspective, a new way of thinking about the concept of the bicycle.
