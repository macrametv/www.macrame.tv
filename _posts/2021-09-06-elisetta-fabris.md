    When you hear stories of people living in the countryside, working from home
    and enjoying the best of nature; you can’t but to feel at least a little bit
    jealous.


    **True, that kind of life isn't for everybody**, but it is a good one for free spirits making their own way in life. It is indeed a good one for Elisetta Fabris.


    **Elisetta is the kind of person that really enjoys the small pleasures of life.** Literally small pleasures, such as the texture of bark, the colour of a mushroom or the mathematical perfection of a flower. That’s why her free spirit found the perfect environment for her creativity to flourish in Nervesa della Battaglia on the “Montello”, a small forest hill above Treviso, Italy.


    **Finding most of her inspiration in nature**, this restless soul enjoys long walks through her own forest, stargazing at night and having the complete and absolute freedom to choose the most interesting and ideal projects for her. A freedom that defines her, her work and her lifestyle.

    **At some point, something happened. One of her high school teachers taught a class on fonts**. Fer had no idea you could make fonts for a living. In fact, she hadn’t even considered graphic design until then. But the shapes were still on her mind so she decided to give it a try.


    **And surprise, surprise... she loved it.** Everything about it. She loved the classes on graphic design, the ways of thinking about design and actually designing. She loved every single letter, every single family of fonts, and that made her see them from a completely different perspective.
