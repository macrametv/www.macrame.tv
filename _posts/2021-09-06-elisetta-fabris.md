    When you hear stories of people living in the countryside, working from home
    and enjoying the best of nature; you can’t but to feel at least a little bit
    jealous.


    **True, that kind of life isn't for everybody**, but it is a good one for free spirits making their own way in life. It is indeed a good one for Elisetta Fabris.


    **Elisetta is the kind of person that really enjoys the small pleasures of life.** Literally small pleasures, such as the texture of bark, the colour of a mushroom or the mathematical perfection of a flower. That’s why her free spirit found the perfect environment for her creativity to flourish in Nervesa della Battaglia on the “Montello”, a small forest hill above Treviso, Italy.


    **Finding most of her inspiration in nature**, this restless soul enjoys long walks through her own forest, stargazing at night and having the complete and absolute freedom to choose the most interesting and ideal projects for her. A freedom that defines her, her work and her lifestyle.
