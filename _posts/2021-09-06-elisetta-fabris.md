  your life and career goals."

    When you hear stories of people living in the countryside, working from home
    and enjoying the best of nature; you can’t but to feel at least a little bit
    jealous.


    **True, that kind of life isn't for everybody**, but it is a good one for free spirits making their own way in life. It is indeed a good one for Elisetta Fabris.


    **Elisetta is the kind of person that really enjoys the small pleasures of life.** Literally small pleasures, such as the texture of bark, the colour of a mushroom or the mathematical perfection of a flower. That’s why her free spirit found the perfect environment for her creativity to flourish in Nervesa della Battaglia on the “Montello”, a small forest hill above Treviso, Italy.


    **Finding most of her inspiration in nature**, this restless soul enjoys long walks through her own forest, stargazing at night and having the complete and absolute freedom to choose the most interesting and ideal projects for her. A freedom that defines her, her work and her lifestyle.

    **"If I wasn’t a designer I would have been a Gondolieri.** I love the idea of sailing people around the most beautiful place on earth".


    **But does she know anything about being a Gondolieri?** Of course not. But that doesn't mean she wouldn't have pursued her dream. Nor does it mean she wouldn't have been able to achieve her goals.


    **"The first time I worked on an animation project I had no idea what I was doing.** I told the client but instead of giving the project to someone else they just answered: “Learn!” And so I did…" 


    **That’s why, when anyone asks, she always says** the key to success in what you are doing is always trial and error:


    **"My best piece of advice for new designers and animators is to do a lot of testing.** Watch lots of tutorials, and try, try and try again."

    get it wrong again"

    > * On The Key of Success


    **It's hard to believe these days,** but this illustrator and animator has never worked in an office, or been employed by a boss in her life. Well, actually she was. For a week. At a design agency. And that was it for her. 


    **It only took her 5 days to realize she needed freedom.** She needed to run away from structures and routines and be able to choose the projects she really wanted to work on; doing so on her own terms. 


    **That was the absolute proof she needed to pursue her freelance career.**
