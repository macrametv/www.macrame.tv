    **So yes, they are pretty much alike. **


    **But Ro Galarza is methodical.** Conscious. She takes every project to the pixel-perfect level. 


    **On the other side, Rocío Gal is impulsive and intuitive.** She loves experimenting and doesn't care for perfection at all.


    **  Ro Galarza is side A.** All mind. Applied creativity and thinking. Rocío Gal is side B. All heart. Pure passion and no consequences.


    **What a perfect combination these two creatives might be.** What a perfect combination, they are.
