    Ro Galarza was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1990. Rocío Gal was also
    born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1990. 


    **Ro Galarza loves music,** illustration, design, motion graphics, and working with colleagues and friends on different projects.  

    **Rocío Gal also loves the exact same things.**

    **So yes, they are pretty much alike.**


    **But Ro Galarza is methodical.** Conscious. She takes every project to the pixel-perfect level.


    **On the other side, Rocío Gal is impulsive and intuitive.** She loves experimenting and doesn't care for perfection at all.


    **Ro Galarza is side A.** All mind. Applied creativity and thinking. Rocío Gal is side B. All heart. Pure passion and no consequences.


    **What a perfect combination these two creatives might be.** What a perfect combination, they are.

    > I have a **very musical approach to design** and a very designed approach
    to music.

    **“And that shapes and inspires everything I do.”**


    **These two unstoppable creatives find their way to think,** feel, create and live together. They share their desk, their musical instruments, and their skin.


    **They can work on a design project for Netflix** or compose a song about fire and anxiety. 


    **They would enjoy working with tons of limitations on colours and shapes** to create a motion film to present Museo Moderno of Buenos Aires’s new font.

    surprise.**

    **Or they would even jump into the absolute freedom of Arriba,** a personal project involving shooting, editing, choreography, costume design, dancing, and more.


    **“I feel like I'm kind of a “graphic searcher”**, continually oscillating between experimentation and structure. My best way of working is when I'm in contact with and open to surprise.”


    **Yes, they are the same person, but they could not be more different.**


    **One, the motion designer and art director** always strikes the right balance between emotion and precision.


    **The other, the singer and musician** does things a little bit differently. When she composes, emotion and expression are the stars. The singer in her doesn't care for perfection, she just needs us to feel. And she achieves that goal, every single time.
