    **Yes, time. Time is a constant in Ariel’s story.** Like the time he was having lunch with his parents and a friend asked if he would go to Europe with him.


    **A week later he was landing in Madrid.**

    Was it an impulsive decision? Some might think so, but the truth is, the time was just right. And he knew it. That trip shaped him in many ways. As a person and as a designer. It shaped him as a typographer. 


    **He also knew when it was the right time to create his own studio.** And that was very early in his career. From the very beginning, Ariel knew he did not want to depend on someone else’s luck or business skills. Having his studio was his way to be in absolute control, to rely only on his own talent and efforts, to feel safe. So, he started his own creative business.
