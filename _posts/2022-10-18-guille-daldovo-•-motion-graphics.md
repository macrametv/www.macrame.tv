    Guille Daldovo was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but that's just a
    coincidence. A small point in a vast timeline of different countries and
    cities. He was born there, but he traveled all around the world. And he
    still does. Because he is always moving, figuratively and literally. 


    **And movement is what he does.**

    What he loves.


    **That’s why this graphic designer quickly found his calling when he first started working at an animation studio, while still in college.** He realized animation was his thing and focused on making things move. And that’s the perfect metaphor for his entire life. That’s what rules every single one of his choices.

    **“I just saw they were working on some animation projects and it was like some kind of flash.** Love at first sight.”


    **So that was it.** That was all he needed to start moving. A moving story that took him almost everywhere. Like in 2006 when he left his job and college and set sail on a quest that took him from Argentina to Costa Rica, stopping in every single country in between.


    **It might sound crazy,** but the craziest thing is that most of his life and groundbreaking opportunities came from traveling.

    agencies in Costa Rica**"

    > * On Traveling


    **“There I was, selling bags on the street in Bolivia,** when a friend called me and said: Come to Costa Rica; I have a job for you. My answer: give me a week to figure it out. A week later, I was there working as an art director for one of the top agencies in Costa Rica”. 


    **Or even the time when he had to render a film in a freezer!** Yes, exactly what it sounds like. He was showcasing an animated movie at a well-known festival, and it was so heavy that his computer kept overheating repeatedly. So he put it in the freezer to keep it cool and get the film rendered. 


    **“Can you imagine?** My computer with my showcased work, right next to the beer that was going to be served during the opening”.


    **That’s what comes from a lifetime of traveling.** Stories. Experiences. And that’s what Guille is full of. That’s why he has this ability to tell stories, to engage with the viewers. Because this go-getter works hard for his dreams, but he travels even harder. And one might say traveling is what inspires him, what creates all these different and incredible scenarios that get straight from his head to the screen.

    > * On Inspiration


    **But his inspiration is not to be found only in different countries' soils.** He goes deeper than that. Literally. He finds most of his inspiration below mother earth. That’s why he loves diving. The undersea world has a unique beauty and charm for him. 


    **“I love diving.** I love the sea. I think it’s a whole different planet. Hidden inside our planet.”


    **And that's why he would have pursued a career in Ocean Studies** if he hadn't been a Graphic Designer and Animator. He loves the water. And water is part of his life. He finds himself comfortable there, like every single morning when he wakes up at 6 am to swim 2000 meters. That changes his mornings. That set the perfect mood to start his day. That inspires him on a regular basis. And that helps him work on personal projects when he has the time. 


    **Since he moved to Barcelona,** he tries to work on one personal project a year. And he does so. Personal projects that aren't just in his portfolio. Those are the base of all his art-based work. Of all his festival entries. Like his project “*Nevada*”, a short animated film based on the classic (and world-famous) Argentinian graphic novel “*El Eternauta*” by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and Francisco Solano López.

    **And that's what led to his freelance life.** A life full of opportunities,
    and risks, of course. But a life full of freedom. Freedom to do, to try, to
    move around. And that's what Guille's career is all about. Freedom.
    Movement. Taking risks. And that's why a freelance life suits him so well. A
    freelance life that lets him collaborate with friends on different projects.
    Inspiring them and also being inspired by them. Like both times he worked
    with Francisco Miranda.


    **Together they've developed two amazing projects:** *Genesis*, an animated short film that won the 4th Pictoplasma Residency Award in 2013, and *Fila* by Jay Funk, a powerful TVC combining animation, motion graphics, and illustration with actual film footage.
