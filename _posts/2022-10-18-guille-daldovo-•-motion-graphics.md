    Guille Daldovo was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but that's just a
    coincidence. A small point in a vast timeline of different countries and
    cities. He was born there, but he traveled all around the world. And he
    still does. Because he is always moving, figuratively and literally. 


    **And movement is what he does.**

    What he loves.


    **That’s why this graphic designer quickly found his calling when he first started working at an animation studio, while still in college.** He realized animation was his thing and focused on making things move. And that’s the perfect metaphor for his entire life. That’s what rules every single one of his choices.

    **“I just saw they were working on some animation projects and it was like some kind of flash.** Love at first sight.”


    **So that was it.** That was all he needed to start moving. A moving story that took him almost everywhere. Like in 2006 when he left his job and college and set sail on a quest that took him from Argentina to Costa Rica, stopping in every single country in between. 


    **It might sound crazy, but the craziest thing is that most of his life and groundbreaking opportunities came from traveling.**
