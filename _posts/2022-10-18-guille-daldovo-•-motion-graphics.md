    Guille Daldovo was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but that's just a
    coincidence. A small point in a vast timeline of different countries and
    cities. He was born there, but he traveled all around the world. And he
    still does. Because he is always moving, figuratively and literally. 


    **And movement is what he does.**

    What he loves.


    **That’s why this graphic designer quickly found his calling when he first started working at an animation studio, while still in college.** He realized animation was his thing and focused on making things move. And that’s the perfect metaphor for his entire life. That’s what rules every single one of his choices.

    **“I just saw they were working on some animation projects and it was like some kind of flash.** Love at first sight.”


    **So that was it.** That was all he needed to start moving. A moving story that took him almost everywhere. Like in 2006 when he left his job and college and set sail on a quest that took him from Argentina to Costa Rica, stopping in every single country in between.


    **It might sound crazy,** but the craziest thing is that most of his life and groundbreaking opportunities came from traveling.

    **She started taking classes on type design and calligraphy**, shaping her career based on her love for letters. And ​now she sells her own fonts.


    **Inspired by people, music and movies,** this typeface artist, calligrapher and designer from Argentina has given several workshops on experimental type design, calligraphy and monograms.


    **She has been a regular at the Tipos Latinos Argentina biennial** since 2010, and her Síncopa Font has been selected for other renowned type design exhibitions such as Pangramme.


    **Is her talent fueled by *mate*, wine, food and the jaded Argentine mindset?**\

    Maybe. Maybe not.


    But one thing's for sure: **Fer's completely different approach to design** can be attributed to her love for letters and expertise.
