    Guille Daldovo was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but that's just a
    coincidence. A small point in a vast timeline of different countries and
    cities. He was born there, but he traveled all around the world. And he
    still does. Because he is always moving, figuratively and literally. 


    **And movement is what he does.**

    What he loves.


    **That’s why this graphic designer quickly found his calling when he first started working at an animation studio, while still in college.** He realized animation was his thing and focused on making things move. And that’s the perfect metaphor for his entire life. That’s what rules every single one of his choices.

    **“I just saw they were working on some animation projects and it was like some kind of flash.** Love at first sight.”


    **So that was it.** That was all he needed to start moving. A moving story that took him almost everywhere. Like in 2006 when he left his job and college and set sail on a quest that took him from Argentina to Costa Rica, stopping in every single country in between.


    **It might sound crazy,** but the craziest thing is that most of his life and groundbreaking opportunities came from traveling.

    > * On Traveling


    **“There I was, selling bags on the street in Bolivia,** when a friend called me and said: Come to Costa Rica; I have a job for you. My answer: give me a week to figure it out. A week later, I was there working as an art director for one of the top agencies in Costa Rica”. 


    **Or even the time when he had to render a film in a freezer!** Yes, exactly what it sounds like. He was showcasing an animated movie at a well-known festival, and it was so heavy that his computer kept overheating repeatedly. So he put it in the freezer to keep it cool and get the film rendered. 


    **“Can you imagine?** My computer with my showcased work, right next to the beer that was going to be served during the opening”.


    **That’s what comes from a lifetime of traveling.** Stories. Experiences. And that’s what Guille is full of. That’s why he has this ability to tell stories, to engage with the viewers. Because this go-getter works hard for his dreams, but he travels even harder. And one might say traveling is what inspires him, what creates all these different and incredible scenarios that get straight from his head to the screen.
