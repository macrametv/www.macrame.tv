    Glass. A powerful material. Fragile, sharp, bright, colourful. The kind of
    material only brave artists can look through and really see what’s coming
    out of it. The kind of material that constantly changes and never returns to
    its previous state. The kind of material Leandro Castelao has in his home
    office and atelier in Cleveland, USA.


    **But this argentinian graphic designer and illustrator, who developed a fine taste in sculpting glass and wood, was not always what he is now.** He is in constant movement, flowing, embracing change: “I never look back. That’s part of who I am. Change, metamorphosis. Staring over and over again, from scratch”.

    **But there's a way more important question here:** was he a great goalkeeper because of his amazing drawing skills? Or is he a talented illustrator because he used his hands to knock flying balls far from the net?


    **We’ll never know for sure.** But one thing we do know is that since he was a little boy, he loved drawing. And playing soccer, of course. But in Martín's own words: “All the memories I have are of me drawing stuff."
