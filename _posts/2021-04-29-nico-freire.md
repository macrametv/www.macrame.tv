    **When you think of a designer you probably think graphic, digital or even
    UX/UI.** 

    When you think of a designer you immediately associate it to his or her area of expertise. 

    You never assume a designer can do it all. That would be just impossible, you think.


    **That’s why, when you think of a designer you think specifics; but you dream of Nico Freire.**


    **Born in 1981, Nico started falling in love with design at an early age:** “I have this joyful memory of me spending my summers reading “Mafalda”. That was my introduction to a visual way of thinking.”


    **And when he was a little bit older, his career path became clear** when he chose the first and most important costume this design chameleon would ever wear:

    > "I remember noticing that most of my favorite comic book artists had graphic design degrees. So I decided **I was going to be a designer, just like them.**"

    **So he did. And he never regretted it.**


    **He was a true design fan from the very beginning.** More specially non-static design. Something that wasn’t even a thing at that time.


    **Something that gave him the desire to learn,** to experiment, to mutate into different designers, all of them in the same skin.

     

    **Something  so in tune with what he was interested in:** music, fashion, trends, beauty and of course, food. 


    **Something we now know as Social Media.**
  section2: >-
    > "**It was extremely new at that time. But what I loved about it was that
    you could control the whole storytelling.** You could actually talk to
    people. And get feedback. Making your own narrative was truly essential."

    >

    > * On Social Media


    **So yes, Nico changes a lot and he loves challenges.** He always thought of design as an experience, even back then, when UX, UI and digital were concepts almost nobody knew of: “I loved thinking of the brand in constant movement. Creating sequences, and videos.”


    **He was doing UI when nobody else was doing UI**


    **He was thinking motion when almost nobody was thinking motion.**
     
    **And that’s what makes him so special.** That’s what he brings to each project he is involved in. That’s what brought him work from amazing clients such as: Nokia, Danone, L’Oreal, Natura, Toyota, Unilever, Herbalife and Tea Connection, a brand he is especially fond of.

    It put everything under a stress test. Both professionally and personally."

    > * On Tea Connection


    **He describes his years at Tea Connection as an enlightening yet exhausting experience.** In other words something Nico just loved, of course.


    **The brand is based on a specialized tea shop chain** with a casual, friendly and chilled yet sophisticated atmosphere. In other words: the perfect ecosystem for him to change, adapt and start exploring again.    


    **He was already working for the brand** when one of Tea Connection’s owners created an in-house design studio and offered Nico to join them. 


    **He knew he was lacking a few soft skills yet,** and the opportunity was perfect to learn them, so he took the offer. 


    **He loved what he was doing.** He enjoyed the process and he took amazing care of the brand. And the relationship evolved. As they usually do. 


    **At some point he started managing teams** and attending meetings, going from a Graphic Designer to the brand’s Art Director.
