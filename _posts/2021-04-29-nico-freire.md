    **When you think of a designer you probably think graphic, digital or even
    UX/UI.** 

    When you think of a designer you immediately associate it to his or her area of expertise. 

    You never assume a designer can do it all. That would be just impossible, you think.


    **That’s why, when you think of a designer you think specifics; but you dream of Nico Freire.**


    **Born in 1981, Nico started falling in love with design at an early age:** “I have this joyful memory of me spending my summers reading “Mafalda”. That was my introduction to a visual way of thinking.”


    **And when he was a little bit older, his career path became clear** when he chose the first and most important costume this design chameleon would ever wear:

    > "I remember noticing that most of my favorite comic book artists had graphic design degrees. So I decided **I was going to be a designer, just like them.**"

    `{{space}}`


    **So he did. And he never regretted it.**


    **He was a true design fan from the very beginning.** More specially non-static design. Something that wasn’t even a thing at that time.


    **Something that gave him the desire to learn,** to experiment, to mutate into different designers, all of them in the same skin.

     

    **Something  so in tune with what he was interested in:** music, fashion, trends, beauty and of course, food. 


    **Something we now know as Social Media.**
